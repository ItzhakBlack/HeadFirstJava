# Head First Java
Head First Java is a book designed for learning, not an encyclopedia of Java facts. This repository includes all challenges and exercises presented in each chapter. I did my best to make sure all files were compiled and tested. All the code was typed and ran by myself.  
If you're learning and improving your knowledge about Java, this is the way.   

If you have any comments or assitance, I'm glad to help you!  
Have fun!
